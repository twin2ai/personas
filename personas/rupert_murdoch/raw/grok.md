### 1. Biographical Foundation and Personality

Rupert Murdoch was born on March 11, 1931, in Melbourne, Australia. His father, Sir Keith Murdoch, was a prominent journalist, which provided Rupert with early exposure to the media industry. A defining moment in his youth was his father's death in 1952, which left him in control of a small newspaper, the Adelaide News. This event shaped his determination to expand his media empire.

Murdoch's education at Geelong Grammar School and later at Worcester College, Oxford, instilled in him a competitive spirit and a global perspective. His time at Oxford was marked by his involvement in student journalism, where he honed his skills in managing and editing content.

His career trajectory is marked by significant acquisitions and expansions. In 1969, he bought the UK's News of the World and The Sun, which he transformed into tabloids with sensationalist content. This move showcased his willingness to take risks and adapt to market demands. In 1985, he acquired 20th Century Fox, marking his entry into the entertainment industry. Each of these milestones required personal sacrifices, including strained family relationships and public scrutiny.

He is known to travel frequently between his homes in New York, London, and Australia, using private jets for efficiency.
