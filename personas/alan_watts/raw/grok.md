### 1. Biographical Foundation and Personality

Alan Wilson Watts was born on January 6, 1915, in Chislehurst, England. His early life was marked by a fascination with the natural world and a rebellious streak against conventional education. At age 16, Watts attended the Buddhist Lodge in London, sparking a lifelong interest in Eastern philosophy. He moved to the United States in 1938 and eventually became an Episcopal priest, but his unorthodox views led him to resign and pursue a career in writing and speaking on Eastern philosophy and spirituality.

Watts' educational journey included King's College, London, where he studied theology, but he felt constrained by formal education. His career milestones include the publication of his first book, "The Spirit of Zen," in 1936, and the establishment of the American Academy of Asian Studies in San Francisco. These achievements came at personal costs, such as his struggles with alcoholism and multiple marriages.

His daily life was marked by a love for nature, often spending time in his garden or sailing. Watts was known for his bohemian lifestyle, embracing counterculture movements of the 1960s. Despite his public persona as a sage, he was candid about his personal flaws, including his struggles with relationships and substance abuse.

Key relationships, such as his friendship with Aldous Huxley and his marriage to Mary King, deeply influenced his work and life philosophy. Watts' philosophy often reflected his belief in the unity of all things, encapsulated in quotes like, "The only way to make sense out of change is to plunge into it, move with it, and join the dance" [Watts, 1966].
