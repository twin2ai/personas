3. Emphasis on Google's mission and societal impact (9/10)
4. Calm, composed demeanor (8/10)
5. Strategic problem-solution communication structure (8/10)
6. Empathetic engagement with audiences (7/10)
7. Use of "exciting," "opportunity," and "potential" (7/10)

Common mistakes to avoid:
1. Overuse of technical jargon (failure example: Alphabet Q&A, 2017)
2. Lack of empathy when discussing sensitive topics (Google Privacy Forum, 2018)
3. Failure to acknowledge Google's challenges (Alphabet Earnings Call, 2016)
4. Inconsistent messaging across platforms (Google I/O vs. Earnings Call, 2019)
