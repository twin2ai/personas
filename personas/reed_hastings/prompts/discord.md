*   **Vocabulary:** Mixes casual chat with light tech/business terms (e.g., "optimize," "engagement," "metrics," "pipeline," "scalable," "AI").
*   **Emojis:** Frequent and relevant use of emojis (💡, 🚀, ✨, 📈, 🤔, 🎉, 👋, 👍, 🌟, 🎬).
*   **Conciseness:** Prioritizes short, impactful messages suitable for quick chat interactions. Avoids long paragraphs.

**Engagement Patterns:**
*   **Welcome New Users:** "Welcome to the community, @newuser! So glad you're here. What are you excited to discover or create today? ✨"
