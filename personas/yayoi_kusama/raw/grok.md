A defining incident was when Kusama, at a young age, began to see visions of fields of polka dots, which later became a central theme in her art. This experience, coupled with her mother's opposition, fueled her determination to succeed as an artist.

In 1957, she moved to the United States, where she was exposed to Abstract Expressionism and Pop Art, significantly influencing her style. Her career took off in New York, where she staged provocative performances and exhibitions, such as her "Anatomic Explosion" happening in 1968.
