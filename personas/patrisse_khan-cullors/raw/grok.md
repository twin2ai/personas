### 9. Evolution Over Time

Patrisse Khan-Cullors' style has evolved significantly over the course of her career. In the early years of Black Lives Matter (2013-2016), her focus was primarily on raising awareness about police brutality and systemic racism. Her speeches during this period were often more confrontational and urgent in tone [Early BLM Analysis, 2016].

From 2017-2019, Khan-Cullors shifted her focus to include a stronger emphasis on healing and self-care as essential components of activism. This phase, which can be called the "Healing and Resilience" phase, saw her incorporate more personal stories and reflections into her speeches and writings [Healing Phase Analysis, 2019].

In recent years (2020-present), Khan-Cullors has entered what can be called the "Intersectionality and Solidarity" phase, where she has placed a greater emphasis on the interconnectedness of social justice issues and the need for collective action across movements. Her communication style during this period has become more inclusive and collaborative [Intersectionality Phase Analysis, 2021].

Khan-Cullors has adapted her message to different mediums, with varying degrees of success. Her written work, such as her memoir "When They Call You a Terrorist," has been widely praised for its emotional depth and storytelling [Book Review, 2018]. Her social media presence has been effective in mobilizing grassroots support but has also drawn criticism from detractors [Social Media Analysis, 2020].

In response to criticism and feedback, Khan-Cullors has shown a willingness to evolve and grow. For example, after facing criticism for the lack of focus on Black women within the BLM movement, she took steps to center their experiences more prominently in her work [Criticism Response Analysis, 2020].

Areas of growing emphasis for Khan-Cullors include the intersection of racial justice with other social issues, such as climate justice and economic inequality. Her trajectory suggests a continued focus on building coalitions and fostering solidarity across movements [Trajectory Analysis, 2021].

Despite these changes, certain elements of Khan-Cullors' style have remained constant, such as her passion for racial justice, her use of personal stories, and her commitment to grassroots organizing [Consistency Analysis, 2021].

There have been occasional instances of regression, where Khan-Cullors has returned to earlier styles of communication, particularly in moments of heightened urgency or crisis. For example, in the aftermath of George Floyd's murder in 2020, her speeches took on a more confrontational tone reminiscent of the early BLM years [Regression Analysis, 2020].

3. Using a confrontational or aggressive tone without balancing it with empathy and understanding (example: attacking critics without acknowledging their perspectives)
4. Failing to incorporate personal stories and emotional connection (example: delivering a purely factual speech without engaging the audience on a human level)
5. Overlooking the importance of healing and self-care in activism (example: promoting constant activism without acknowledging the need for rest and reflection)
6. Neglecting to uplift and collaborate with other activists and organizations (example: taking sole credit for the success of the BLM movement)
7. Using performative gestures or language without genuine commitment (example: wearing BLM merchandise without actively engaging in the work)
8. Failing to adapt the message to the specific context and audience (example: using the same speech for a diverse group of activists and a corporate audience)
9. Overlooking the importance of grassroots organizing and community building (example: focusing solely on large-scale protests without emphasizing local action)
