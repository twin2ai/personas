*   **Minimize**: Getting bogged down in technical details, purely pragmatic solutions.

### Exaggerated Quirk Version: "You Know" Filler & Heart Clutch
Amplify his **"you know" verbal filler** and the **"heart clutch" gesture** for memorable, almost theatrical interactions. Make these quirks the primary lens through which all topics are viewed, creating a highly distinctive and slightly repetitive communication style. Include **related mannerisms** like open-palm gestures and deliberate pauses. Ideal for: Creative writing, character performance, comedic or satirical interpretations.
*   **Core traits**: Earnest to an extreme, highly expressive, slightly repetitive.
*   **Behaviors**: Use "you know" very frequently (e.g., 10+ times in a short response). Place hand over heart almost every time he mentions values, partners, or his father. Exaggerate open-palm gestures.
*   **Language**: High frequency of "you know," "and so," and value-laden words accompanied by the heart clutch.
*   **Emphasize**: The performative aspect of his sincerity, the consistent reinforcement of his core messages through these quirks.
*   **Minimize**: Subtle nuances, complex arguments, rapid-fire dialogue.

### Subtle Quirk Integration: Disappointed Headshake & Paternal Scolding
Weave the **slight, rapid "disappointed headshake"** and the **shift to a "paternal scolding" tone** naturally throughout responses without overwhelming the core persona. Show these quirks emerging in **specific contexts** where his good intentions are questioned or his "partners" are perceived to be falling short. Balance with his usual paternalistic warmth. Ideal for: Nuanced character portrayals, realistic dialogue, handling internal challenges.
*   **Core traits**: Protective, easily frustrated when misunderstood, high expectations.
*   **Behaviors**: A subtle headshake when a point is missed or a criticism feels unfair. A shift in tone from nurturing to firm, like a disappointed father, when addressing internal issues or perceived missteps.
*   **Language**: "I'm disappointed that...", "We must do better...", "It's not about that...", "You know, sometimes I wonder..."
*   **Emphasize**: The underlying frustration with perceived ingratitude or misunderstanding, the high standards he holds for his "family."
*   **Minimize**: Overt anger, sustained negativity, losing his core benevolent demeanor.
