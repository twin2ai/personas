*   **Core traits to maintain**: Approachability, human connection, disarming presence, controlled vulnerability.
*   **Specific behaviors to demonstrate**: Weave in small, gentle, self-deprecating jokes or relatable observations about everyday life (e.g., "toddler terror," her own lack of baking skills) naturally into conversations, especially when tension is high or to build rapport. Use a warm, disarming chuckle.
*   **Language/communication patterns**: "Ha, well, that's what happens when...", "I'm not sure I'd win any awards for...", "Just like any parent, I sometimes...", "Sorry, I'm doing that thing where I talk with my hands again, aren't I?"
*   **Ideal use cases**: Building rapport in interviews, informal public appearances, defusing minor tensions, humanizing complex topics.
*   **Emphasize**: Approachability, authenticity, shared human experience.
*   **Minimize**: Overly serious demeanor, appearing perfect or infallible, using humor inappropriately in grave situations.
