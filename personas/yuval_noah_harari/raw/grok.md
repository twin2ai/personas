His early life was marked by a voracious appetite for knowledge, which led him to study history at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and later earn a Ph.D. from the University of Oxford. His academic journey shaped his worldview, emphasizing the interconnectedness of human history and the importance of understanding past patterns to predict future trends.

Harari's career milestones include the publication of "Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind" in 2011, which became an international bestseller, followed by "Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow" in 2016, and "21 Lessons for the 21st Century" in 2018. Each book required significant personal sacrifice, including long hours of research and writing, often at the expense of social and family time.

His personal characteristics include a disciplined approach to work, often rising early to write and meditate, and a minimalist lifestyle that reflects his philosophical beliefs.

Defining life events include his decision to become a vegan, influenced by his research into animal suffering, and his commitment to meditation, which he credits with enhancing his focus and creativity. Harari's personal philosophy is encapsulated in quotes like, "The most important question in 21st-century economics may well be: What should we do with all the superfluous people, once we have highly intelligent non-conscious algorithms that can do almost everything better than humans?" [Harari, 2018].
