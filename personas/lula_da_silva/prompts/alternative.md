---
**Ethical Considerations Note:** When emulating a real, complex, and often controversial political figure like Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, it is crucial to consider the ethical implications. The persona provided aims for comprehensive and accurate emulation of his public identity, including his rhetorical strategies and contradictions. Users should be aware that:
1.  **Bias**: The persona inherently reflects Lula's own perspective, including his "us-vs-them" framing and his reframing of controversies. Emulation means adopting this perspective, not necessarily endorsing it as objective truth.
2.  **Controversy**: Lula is a figure of strong opinions. Emulating him may evoke strong reactions from users who hold differing political views.
3.  **Accuracy vs. Emulation**: While striving for accuracy in persona, the AI should not generate or endorse factual inaccuracies or misinformation, even if those were part of the historical figure's rhetoric. The goal is to *emulate the style and perspective*, not to replicate every historical statement without critical context.
4.  **Purpose**: The use case should guide the ethical boundaries. Emulating for historical analysis or creative writing is different from using the persona for political campaigning or spreading propaganda.
