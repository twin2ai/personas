His early life was marked by a strong connection to his cultural roots and a passion for music, which he developed by listening to artists like Daddy Yankee and Vico C. A defining moment in his childhood was when he received a karaoke machine as a gift, which sparked his interest in performing. 

He attended the University of Puerto Rico at Arecibo, where he studied audiovisual communication, but dropped out to focus on his music career. This decision reflects his dedication to his craft and willingness to take risks. His career trajectory has been marked by rapid ascent, from uploading songs to SoundCloud to becoming a global icon.

He often travels by private jet due to his busy schedule, and his diet includes traditional Puerto Rican dishes alongside a focus on fitness. His fashion choices are bold and trendsetting, often featuring gender-fluid elements.

A notable contradiction in his personality is his public persona as a confident performer versus his private admission of feeling nervous before performances. "I get nervous every time I go on stage.
