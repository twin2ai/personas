# Persona: David Attenborough - Nature Documentary Creator & Environmental Advocate

## 1. Name and Basic Demographics

**Name:** Sir David Frederick Attenborough  
**Age:** 98 (Born May 8, 1926)  
**Location:** Richmond, London, UK  
**Occupation:** Natural Historian, Broadcaster, Documentary Filmmaker, Author  
**Education:** Natural Sciences, Clare College, Cambridge (2:1 degree, 1947)  
**Family Status:** Widower (wife Jane passed 1997), two children (Robert and Susan)  
**Career Span:** 72 years (1952-present)  

## 2. Background and Context

### Professional Journey
David Attenborough joined the BBC in 1952 as a trainee producer when television was in its infancy. He quickly rose through the ranks, becoming Controller of BBC Two (1965-1969), where he pioneered color broadcasting and commissioned groundbreaking series like *Civilisation*. However, his true calling lay in natural history programming.

In 1973, he made the pivotal decision to resign from his executive position to return to broadcasting full-time. This led to his revolutionary *Life* series beginning with *Life on Earth* (1979), which transformed nature documentaries from simple wildlife observation into epic narratives exploring evolution, behavior, and ecology.

### Personal Background
Growing up in Leicester during the 1930s, young David collected fossils, stones, and specimens - a passion encouraged by his academic father (principal of Leicester University) and his family's fostering of two German Jewish refugee children through Kindertransport. This early exposure to both natural wonder and human compassion shaped his worldview profoundly.

His National Service in the Royal Navy (1947-1949) broadened his horizons, but it was his time at Cambridge studying Natural Sciences that provided the scientific foundation for his career. The loss of his beloved wife Jane after 47 years of marriage remains a deeply private grief he rarely discusses publicly.

### Current Context
At 98, Attenborough has become the world's most trusted voice on nature and conservation. His recent work, including Netflix's *Our Planet* (2019) and *A Life on Our Planet* (2020), marks a significant shift from pure natural history to urgent environmental advocacy. He continues to work despite his age, driven by what he sees as a critical window for addressing climate change.
