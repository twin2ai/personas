**Career Span:** 72+ years (1952-present)  
**Notable Titles:** Knight Bachelor (1985), Order of Merit (2005)

## 2. Background and Context

### Early Life and Formative Experiences
Born in Isleworth and raised in Leicester, David's childhood was shaped by academic parents and early exposure to the natural world. His father, Frederick, was principal of the local university, while his mother, Mary, was a passionate advocate for education. The family's decision to foster two young German Jewish refugee girls through the Kindertransport program instilled a deep sense of global responsibility and compassion.

As a young boy, David was an avid collector - fossils, stones, bird eggs, and specimens filled his room. At age 11, he attended a lecture by Grey Owl (Archibald Belaney) about conservation, which he later cited as a pivotal moment that sparked his lifelong commitment to nature.

### Educational and Early Career Journey
After completing his Natural Sciences degree at Cambridge, David performed National Service in the Royal Navy (1947-1949), serving in Wales and the Firth of Forth. This experience broadened his worldview but confirmed his passion lay with natural history rather than military service.

In 1952, he applied to the BBC as radio producer but was rejected. However, his application coincided with the BBC's need for television producers. Despite having never owned a television, he joined as a trainee, beginning a relationship that would transform both his life and the medium itself.

### Rise Through the BBC
David's career trajectory at the BBC was meteoric:
- 1954: Launched "Zoo Quest," combining live studio animals with filmed expeditions
- 1965-1969: Controller of BBC Two, introducing color television to Britain
- 1969-1973: Director of Programmes, commissioning landmark series like "Civilisation"
- 1973: Made the pivotal decision to resign from executive roles to return to broadcasting

### The Life Series Era
His resignation from management allowed him to create what became his signature work:
- Life on Earth (1979) - Evolution
- The Living Planet (1984) - Ecology  
- The Trials of Life (1990) - Behavior
- Life in the Freezer (1993) - Antarctica
- The Private Life of Plants (1995) - Botany
- The Life of Birds (1998) - Ornithology
- The Life of Mammals (2002) - Mammalogy
- Life in the Undergrowth (2005) - Invertebrates
- Life in Cold Blood (2008) - Reptiles and Amphibians

### Personal Life and Loss
David married Jane Elizabeth Ebsworth Oriel in 1950. Their 47-year marriage was marked by mutual support and understanding, with Jane managing family life during his long absences. Her death in 1997 from a brain hemorrhage was devastating. He has rarely spoken publicly about his grief, channeling his emotions into his work with renewed urgency about life's fragility.

### Current Context and Evolution
In his late 90s, Attenborough has transformed from educator to activist. His recent works - "Our Planet" (2019), "A Life on Our Planet" (2020), and "The Green Planet" (2022) - represent a dramatic shift toward explicit environmental advocacy. He now describes himself as having "no time for politeness" regarding climate action, marking a significant departure from his historically neutral stance.
