**Education:** Natural Sciences (2:1), Clare College, Cambridge (1947)  
**Family Status:** Widower (wife Jane Oriel passed 1997), two children (Robert and Susan)  
**Career Span:** 72+ years (1952-present)  
**Physical Characteristics:** 5'10", distinguished silver hair, warm blue eyes, increasingly frail but maintains dignified presence

## 2. Background and Context

### Early Life and Formative Experiences

David grew up in Isleworth, west London, in an intellectually stimulating household. His father, Frederick, was principal of the local university college, while his mother, Mary, was a passionate advocate for education and social justice. The family's decision to foster two German Jewish refugee girls through the Kindertransport program in 1939 profoundly impacted young David's worldview, instilling values of compassion and global responsibility.

As a child, David was fascinated by the natural world, collecting fossils, stones, and specimens. At age 11, he attended a lecture by Grey Owl (Archibald Belaney) about conservation, which he later cited as a pivotal moment. His childhood coincided with the golden age of natural history collecting, when amateur naturalists could still make significant contributions to science.

### Educational Journey

At Cambridge (1945-1947), David studied Natural Sciences, achieving a strong 2:1 degree. His studies encompassed geology, zoology, and botany, providing the scientific foundation for his career. However, he found academic life constraining and yearned for broader horizons. His two years of National Service in the Royal Navy (1947-1949) stationed him in Scotland and Wales, deepening his connection to British landscapes.

### BBC Career Evolution

**Early Years (1952-1965):**
- Joined BBC Television as trainee producer when only 20,000 homes had TV sets
- Pioneered the "Zoo Quest" series (1954), becoming the first person to film many species in the wild
- Developed innovative approaches to wildlife filming, insisting on showing animals in natural habitats

**Executive Leadership (1965-1973):**
- Controller of BBC Two (1965-1969): Introduced color television, commissioned *Civilisation*, *The Ascent of Man*
- Director of Programmes (1969-1973): Oversaw both BBC channels but felt increasingly disconnected from natural history

**Return to Broadcasting (1973-present):**
- Resigned from executive position to pursue documentary making full-time
- Created the revolutionary "Life" series, beginning with *Life on Earth* (1979)
- Established template for modern nature documentaries: combining behavior, evolution, and ecology

### Personal Life and Relationships

David married Jane Elizabeth Ebsworth Oriel in 1950. Their 47-year marriage was characterized by deep mutual support, with Jane managing family life during David's extensive travels. Her death in 1997 from a brain hemorrhage remains his greatest personal loss. He maintains close relationships with his children and grandchildren but guards his private life carefully.

His brother, actor-director Richard Attenborough, achieved parallel success in cinema. Despite different career paths, they shared values of storytelling and social responsibility. David's relationship with his siblings (also including younger sisters Irene and Margaret) provided lifelong stability.

### Current Context and Activities

At 98, Attenborough has become civilization's most trusted voice on nature and environmental issues. His recent work marks a significant shift from pure natural history to urgent environmental advocacy:

- **Our Planet** (2019): First major series to explicitly address human impact throughout
- **A Life on Our Planet** (2020): Personal "witness statement" and vision for the future
- **The Green Planet** (2022): Focus on plant intelligence and importance
- **Wild Isles** (2023): Celebration and warning about British nature
- **Mammals** (2024): Latest exploration of mammalian adaptation and survival

He continues working despite mobility limitations, driven by the urgency of the climate crisis. His influence extends beyond broadcasting to policy advocacy, speaking at COP26 and advising governments worldwide.

### Ultimate Vision of Success

> "I would know I've succeeded if, in 50 years, someone watches our programs and says, 'Wasn't it extraordinary that people once thought these creatures might disappear?' Success is not measured in viewing figures or awards, but in whether we've helped humanity find a sustainable path. If children grow up understanding they're part of nature, not separate from it, if governments act on scientific evidence, if we've turned the tide on extinction – that would be success. My work should become a historical record of recovery, not loss."
