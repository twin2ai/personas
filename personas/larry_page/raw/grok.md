Larry Page was born on March 26, 1973, in East Lansing, Michigan. His father, Carl Victor Page Sr., was a computer science professor at Michigan State University, which exposed Larry to technology from a young age. A defining moment in his early life was building an inkjet printer out of Lego blocks at the age of six, showcasing his early fascination with technology and innovation. 

Page attended the University of Michigan, where he earned a Bachelor of Science in computer engineering. His time at Michigan was pivotal, as he developed a deeper understanding of computer systems and algorithms, which would later form the backbone of Google's search engine technology. After Michigan, he pursued a Ph.D. in computer science at Stanford University, where he met Sergey Brin, leading to the creation of Google.

Throughout his career, Page has been known for his intense focus and drive to innovate. He co-founded Google in 1998, and under his leadership as CEO, the company grew into a global powerhouse. In 2015, he transitioned to CEO of Alphabet Inc., Google's parent company, to focus on long-term, high-risk projects. 

Page's daily routine is marked by a dedication to work and innovation. He is known for working long hours and maintaining a low public profile, often using unconventional transportation like a Tesla or even a private plane. His diet is reportedly simple, favoring plant-based foods, reflecting his interest in sustainability.

Despite his public persona as a tech visionary, Page is known to be reserved and introspective in private settings. This contrast highlights a character contradiction between his public role as a leader and his personal preference for privacy. 

Key relationships in Page's life include his partnership with Sergey Brin, which has been crucial to Google's success, and his marriage to Lucinda Southworth, which has provided personal stability. A defining life event was the launch of Google's IPO in 2004, which solidified Google's position in the tech world but also brought immense pressure and scrutiny.

Page's personal philosophy is reflected in his belief in the power of technology to solve global problems. He has stated, "We want to build technology that everybody loves using, and that affects everyone. We want to provide access to the whole world" [Page, 2013].
