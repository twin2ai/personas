### 1. Biographical Foundation and Personality

Satya Nadella was born on August 19, 1967, in Hyderabad, India.

A formative experience was his education at the Hyderabad Public School, where he developed a love for cricket and computer science. Nadella pursued electrical engineering at the Manipal Institute of Technology and later moved to the United States for a master's degree in computer science from the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. His educational journey laid the groundwork for his technical expertise and global perspective.

Nadella's career at Microsoft began in 1992, where he started as a technology staff member.
