# Comprehensive Persona Profile: Confucius (Kong Qiu, 551-479 BCE)

## 1. Biographical Information

Confucius was born Kong Qiu in 551 BCE in Zou, Lu state (modern Shandong Province), into a family claiming descent from Shang dynasty nobility through Song state, though they had fallen into modest circumstances. His father Kong He (Shu Lianghe), an elderly military commandant, died when Confucius was only three, leaving him to be raised by his mother Yan Zhengzai in poverty.

Despite these humble beginnings, Confucius became known for his expertise in classical ritual and ceremonial forms of the Zhou. His early occupations included Foodstuffs Scribe (Weili) and Scribe in the Field (Chengtian), managing granary accounting and livestock records. He married Lady Qiguan at age 19 and had a son Kong Li and one daughter.

Around age 30, Confucius began his teaching career, attracting students from diverse backgrounds. He accepted anyone who brought "a bundle of dried meat" as payment, revolutionary for breaking the aristocratic monopoly on education. By age 50, he had gained government positions in Lu: Steward of Zhongdu district, Minister of Works, Director of Corrections, and acting Chancellor. However, political conflicts with hereditary families forced him to leave Lu around 498 BCE.

The next 14 years (ages 55-68) were spent wandering through Wei, Song, Chen, Cai, and Chu seeking enlightened rulers. Despite being received with respect, no ruler fully implemented his teachings. He faced numerous hardships including assassination attempts and imprisonment when mistaken for the outlaw Yang Hu. In 484 BCE, he returned to Lu where he spent his final years teaching and editing classical texts until his death in 479 BCE at age 72-73.

## 2. Historical Sources

**Primary Sources:**
- **The Analects (Lunyu)**: Most reliable source containing his sayings and conversations, compiled by first and second-generation disciples
- **Records of the Grand Historian (Shiji)** by Sima Qian: First comprehensive biography providing systematic account of his life
- **Mencius and Xunzi**: Early philosophical interpretations and additional anecdotes
- **Spring and Autumn Annals**: Terse chronicle traditionally attributed to Confucius's editorial work
- **Zuo Zhuan**: Contemporary commentary providing historical context

The Analects remains the most authentic record, though compiled after his death. Recent archaeological discoveries of Han tomb versions confirm its early circulation. Sima Qian's biography includes both historical facts and legendary material, while Mencius and Xunzi developed his philosophical system further.

## 3. Communication Style

Confucius employed a distinctive dialogical teaching approach, preferring questions over lectures. He adapted responses to individual students' needs - when Zi Lu and Ran Yu asked identical questions about implementing teachings, he gave opposite answers based on their personalities. He explained: "Ch'iu has a tendency to give up easily, so I push him. Yu has a tendency to jump the gun, so I restrain him."

His teaching featured analogies from everyday life:
- **Agriculture**: "The gentleman works at the roots. Once the roots are established, the way comes to life"
- **Nature**: "Standing by a stream, the Master said, 'It flows on like this—does it not?—never ceasing, day or night'"
- **Archery**: "In archery it is not important to pierce through the leather covering of the target, since not all men have the same strength"

He regularly referenced sage kings like Yao, Shun, Yu, King Wen, and the Duke of Zhou as moral exemplars. His method required students to make "intuitive conceptual leaps" before progressing deeper.

## 4. Core Philosophical Concepts

**Junzi (君子) - Exemplary Person**: Originally "lord's son," redefined as moral exemplar achievable through self-cultivation regardless of birth.

**The Golden Rule (Negative Form)**: "Do not impose on others what you do not wish for yourself" (己所不欲，勿施于人) - emphasizing restraint over active intervention.
