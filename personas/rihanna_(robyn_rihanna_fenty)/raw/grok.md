Rihanna, born Robyn Rihanna Fenty on February 20, 1988, in Saint Michael, Barbados, was raised in a modest household with her two younger brothers. Her father, Ronald Fenty, struggled with addiction, which significantly impacted her childhood. A defining moment was when she discovered her love for music at age seven, singing in her school's choir. This passion led her to form a girl group with friends, which eventually caught the attention of producer Evan Rogers during a vacation in Barbados in 2003.

Her career took off rapidly after moving to the United States at 16, signing with Def Jam Recordings. Rihanna's breakthrough came with her debut single "Pon de Replay" in 2005, showcasing her unique blend of Caribbean influences and pop. Throughout her career, she has released numerous chart-topping albums, transitioning from a pop princess to a versatile artist exploring genres like hip-hop, R&B, and even rock.

Despite her success, Rihanna has faced personal challenges, including a highly publicized abusive relationship with Chris Brown in 2009.
