His early life was marked by a keen interest in numbers and business. At age six, he sold Coca-Cola door-to-door, foreshadowing his later investment in the company.

His entrepreneurial spirit was evident when he owned a pinball machine business in high school, which he sold for a profit.

**Educational Background:**
Buffett attended the University of Nebraska, where he graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration in 1950. Rejected by Harvard Business School, he enrolled at Columbia Business School, where he studied under Benjamin Graham, the father of value investing. Graham's teachings on intrinsic value and margin of safety profoundly influenced Buffett's investment philosophy. He received the only A+ Graham ever awarded, and named his son Howard Graham Buffett after his mentor.

**Career Milestones:**
- **1956**: Buffett founded the Buffett Partnership with $105,000, which grew significantly over the years.
