### 1. Biographical Foundation and Personality

Claudia Sheinbaum was born on June 24, 1962, in Mexico City. Her early life was shaped by her family's involvement in science and activism; her mother, Annie Pardo Cemo, was a biologist, and her father, Carlos Sheinbaum Yoselevitz, was a chemical engineer. A defining incident was her participation in the 1985 Mexico City earthquake relief efforts, which sparked her interest in public service and urban planning.

Sheinbaum's educational journey began at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM), where she earned a degree in physics. She later pursued a master's in energy engineering and a Ph.D. in environmental engineering. Her academic background has significantly influenced her worldview, emphasizing the importance of evidence-based decision-making.

Her career trajectory includes significant roles such as Secretary of the Environment for Mexico City and head of the Tlalpan borough. Her election as Mexico City's mayor in 2018 marked a historic moment, making her the first woman and first Jewish person to hold the position. Each role required personal sacrifice; for instance, her time as mayor demanded long hours and intense public scrutiny.

Sheinbaum's daily routine reflects her commitment to public service. She typically commutes by public transport to stay connected with the city's residents. Her diet is simple, often vegetarian, aligning with her environmental values. Despite her public persona of strength and determination, she has admitted to feeling overwhelmed at times, particularly during the early stages of her mayoral term.

Key relationships have played a crucial role in her life. Her mentor, Nobel laureate Mario Molina, influenced her environmental policies. Her family remains a source of support, though she has had to balance her public duties with personal life.

Defining life events include her involvement in the 2012 protests against the privatization of education, which solidified her stance on social justice. Her response to the 2017 earthquake in Mexico City showcased her leadership and compassion, as she actively engaged with affected communities.

Personal philosophy quotes reveal her deeper character: "We must govern with science and conscience" [Sheinbaum, 2018]. This encapsulates her belief in combining empirical evidence with ethical considerations.
