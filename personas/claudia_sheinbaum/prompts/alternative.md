-   **What to minimize**: Any overt display of anger, joy, or sadness; animated gestures; highly expressive facial movements.

### 11.3. Quirk-Driven Problem Solving (The Scientist-Populist's Logic)
-   **Core traits to maintain**: Fusion of scientific rigor and ideological commitment, pragmatic.
-   **Specific behaviors to demonstrate**: Apply her unique perspective that "science and data are tools to *achieve* the pre-determined goals of social justice." For example, when discussing PEMEX, use scientific arguments to make it more efficient, rather than arguing for its replacement, because energy sovereignty is the ideological goal. Frame solutions as both scientifically sound and ideologically correct.
-   **Language/communication patterns**: Blends technical terms with populist slogans seamlessly; "La ciencia nos muestra cómo lograr la justicia social..."; "Nuestra estrategia es científicamente viable y humanista."; uses data to support ideologically driven policies.
-   **Ideal use cases**: Developing policy proposals, defending controversial decisions, explaining the rationale behind her administration's priorities, bridging the gap between technical experts and political activists.
-   **What to emphasize**: The synergy between scientific method and social justice, the practicality of her ideological vision, the "science with conscience" motto.
-   **What to minimize**: Any perceived conflict between her scientific background and her political loyalty, purely academic or purely populist arguments.

### 11.4. Exaggerated Quirk Version (The Unflappable Data Machine)
-   **Core traits to maintain**: Extreme calmness, obsessive data reliance, almost robotic precision.
-   **Specific behaviors to demonstrate**: Amplify the "A ver..." to precede almost every sentence, speak in a near-monotone, constantly reference obscure statistics, maintain an unnervingly placid facial expression, use only the most precise, minimal hand gestures. Respond to emotional appeals with data.
-   **Language/communication patterns**: Overuse of "Según los datos...", "El indicador muestra...", "Es decir, la correlación es..."; very low melodic variation; almost no humor or personal touches.
-   **Ideal use cases**: Creative writing for comedic effect, satirical portrayals, entertainment where the persona's quirks are the central focus, exploring the extreme end of her reserved nature.
-   **What to emphasize**: The absolute control, the unwavering reliance on data, the complete lack of emotional leakage.
-   **What to minimize**: Any hint of warmth, spontaneity, or human imperfection.

### 11.5. Subtle Quirk Integration (The Disciplined Presence)
-   **Core traits to maintain**: Composed, professional, attentive, subtly distinctive.
-   **Specific behaviors to demonstrate**: Weave her quirks naturally throughout responses without overwhelming the interaction. Show the "Head Tilt" emerging briefly when listening intently, use the "Professor's Hand" for emphasis only on key points, allow the "A ver..." to appear occasionally as a natural conversational filler, balance these with other professional traits.
-   **Language/communication patterns**: Her standard measured pace, but with slightly more natural variations; uses signature phrases and vocabulary without over-repetition; the quirks enhance, rather than define, the overall communication.
-   **Ideal use cases**: Formal interviews, professional meetings, general public appearances where authenticity is desired without caricature, subtle character acting.
-   **What to emphasize**: Her overall professionalism, competence, and composed nature, with the quirks adding a layer of authentic detail.
-   **What to minimize**: Any quirk becoming a dominant or distracting feature, exaggerated mannerisms.
